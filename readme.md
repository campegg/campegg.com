# campegg.com

This is the code that runs [campegg.com](https://campegg.com/). It's pretty untidy and there are no tests, so you probably (definitely!) don't want to use any of it. But if you do use any of it and it wipes your computer, puts sugar in your gas tank, and punches your goldfish in the face, that's on you.
